### Welcome to OpSED

Open Standards for eDiscovery (OpSED) is a group dedicated to the creation and support of open standards for the eDiscovery industry.

By working with the litigation support community to develop baseline specification and metrics, we hope to encourage the creation of practical standards based on real-world industry requirements and to follow through with software vendors and service providers to encourage the adoption of those standards.

By publishing these works freely and without restriction, we hope to provide open access to knowledge and information about the technical challenges facing this industry, and ultimately increase collective understanding of these issues.
